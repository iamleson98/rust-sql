Task ID: 5
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Rebuilt workspace after reset; verify HEAD; close the non-BINARY collation gap (write side + engine semantics)

Work Log:
- Environment was wiped mid-session: re-cloned iamleson98/rust-sql from GitHub (token from the recovered CI poll script), reinstalled rust stable 1.98.1 + clippy + rustfmt. Remote state: b1ed5b6 CI FAILED (4x clippy lints in probe_par_join + macOS torture S08 jitter under the 2.0ms floor) — ALREADY fixed by 31ca53e (CI green), which also shipped the index-overflow gap closure 2b50cea (CI green). Dev matrix at HEAD: 683/683.
- Probe (examples/probe_coll_write.rs, real SQLite judges the written file): NOCASE write side was already correct for explicit/inherited/autoindex/DESC indexes (integrity_check ok) — but WITHOUT ROWID NOCASE PKs wrote rows in scan order ("row not in PRIMARY KEY order"). FIX: build_bytes now passes pk_collations to build_record_tree for every non-BINARY-PK / non-UTF-8 WithoutRowid (was: UTF-8 always skipped the sort, trusting the caller's order).
- Probe also exposed ENGINE-side collation bugs, all fixed:
  1. ORDER BY on a column with a DECLARED collation sorted BINARY (resolve_order_by_terms now attaches the term's collation — declared for bare-column terms, explicit COLLATE read from the ORIGINAL term so the aggregate rewrite can't lose it).
  2. Index selection matched columns by NAME only: a BINARY equality could seek a NOCASE index (wrong rows). Added index_column_serves_conjunct gates in apply_where_for_scan (first + prefix columns), try_index_in, try_index_range; extractors (eq/range/between) now see through COLLATE-wrapped operands.
  3. The OLTP FastPaths (IndexPoint/IndexCount) did not fold probe keys — literal pre-encoding AND runtime parameter encoding now fold through the index columns' collations; uppercase probes over NOCASE indexes found 0 rows before.
  4. Project{Aggregate{IndexLookup}} FastPath lacked the COUNT-only gate: SUM/MIN/MAX/GROUP_CONCAT over an index equality returned the MATCH COUNT as their value (pre-existing correctness bug; gated now).
  5. GROUP BY under the term's collation: HashGrouper folds keys for hash/equality (spill codec + parallel merges stay consistent), keeps each group's FIRST-SEEN ORIGINAL as the display/representative (SQLite's output); wired in scan_groupby_grouper (serial + both parallel paths + merge groupers) and the generic path (collect_plan_tables alias-aware scope walk); RamTail/finish emit the representative.
  6. rewrite_aggregates_and_groups now matches projections/ORDER BY terms to GROUP BY terms through an explicit COLLATE wrapper (was NULL output columns).
  7. UPDATE/DELETE planning never passed through rewrite_column_collations — declared-collation WHERE clauses compared BINARY (and the new gates declined the matching index). plan_update/plan_delete now rewrite the predicate with the target table's scope first.
- tests/collate_semantics.rs (19 differential suites vs bundled SQLite): ORDER BY (declared/explicit/alias/ordinal/DESC/RTRIM), index probes (equality/IN/range/BETWEEN, both mismatch directions), fast-path folding (literals + parameters), GROUP BY (declared, explicit-COLLATE, multi-term mixed, join-qualified, filter+HAVING, RTRIM, first-seen representative both orders), UPDATE/DELETE through NOCASE indexes, 300k-row parallel collated GROUP BY serial-equality.
- Verification: dev matrix 702/702, release matrix 702/702, fmt clean, clippy -D warnings clean (default + no-default + sqlx). probe_coll_write: all 5 file-write shapes integrity-ok with SQLite re-opening.

Stage Summary:
- Collation ledger entry closed: NOCASE/RTRIM writes (explicit, column-declared, autoindex, WITHOUT ROWID PK, DESC) + engine-side collation semantics (ORDER BY, index gating, probe folding, GROUP BY incl. parallel/spill, DML WHERE). Remaining: custom collations still binary in written files (no portable encoding).
- 3 pre-existing correctness bugs found by the new differential suite: FastPath aggregate-value-as-count, UPDATE/DELETE collation-blind WHERE, NOCASE index probing with unfolded keys.
- 702 tests; ready to commit + push (README + worklog updated).
